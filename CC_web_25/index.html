   Bitters the cat, November 2023
  </p>
  <p>
   In this photograph, (taken by his funcle (fun uncle) Aidan) a very young and spry Bitters walks atop a dining room table in Hells Kitchen. The cat—more appropriately titled "kitten" at this point—is less than a year old. He lives with his mother (a 20 year-old boy) and his two uncles, all of whom feed him very much.

   Bitters was born feral in upstate New York, but now resides in Manhattan.
